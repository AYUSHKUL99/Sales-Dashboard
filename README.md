Footwear Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project presents a multi–page Footwear Sales Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI.
It analyzes customer behavior, product performance, sales channels, daily/seasonal patterns, and revenue trends across regions in the United States.

The dashboard helps business stakeholders answer:

Which product contributes most to revenue?

Which sales channels are performing best?

Which states or regions need more focus?

What are the peak sales periods for footwear?

How do weekdays, weekends, and months impact performance?
